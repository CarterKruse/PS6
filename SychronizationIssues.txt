Synchronization Issues
Carter Kruse & John DeForest, Dartmouth CS 10, Spring 2022

With multiple clients, various unexpected behaviors are possible. The addition, movement, recoloring, or deletion of
shapes may not be consistent across multiple editors if we do not account for handling multiple threads that are
accessing shared resources at the same time. In this case, the shared resource is the IDMap, with the IDs of shapes
and the shapes themselves to be displayed on each editor.

Prior to making our program "atomic" with the synchronized keyword, we encountered instances of this happening,
particularly with the deletion of objects. Now that we synchronized the handleAdd(), handleMove(), handleRecolor(),
handleDelete(), handleAddID() methods (and addShape(), moveShape(), recolorShape(), deleteShape(), drawSketch()), we
no longer see issues with the code.

In theory, this should handle the issues encountered with multithreading. :)
